// ===================================================
// A very light framework, which has printable styles
// at it's heart. This means we want it nicely printed,
// saved as a PDF, or viewed in an eReader. It's also
// nice as a solid base for your own projects, which
// don't have to be "print first".
//
// I often save things as PDFs and occasionally print
// them, so it's always nice to make an effort for that
// kind of job a person hires your website for.

// Our MAIN configuration file
// -------------------------
// Sets up the `print-first-css` framework, `--variables`
// you can use and extend in your project, and a basic
// `monochrome` theme that you can use with Pandoc.

// 1. Our main reset, `normalize.css` first (3rd party
//    styles) ... Then our other (minor) resets!
//    (our own styles)
//
//    #! `normalize.css` is very old. There's also some
//    duplicate code â€” I'm doing the `monospace` trick in
//    `typography.less`, for instance.
//
// 2. All of our base (raw) html styles. You should aim
//    to create a specimen file with as much as possible
//    styled upfront here.
//
// 3. Now we begin our `GPS` and `ECSS` hybrid. GPS for
//    most of the things, and some `ECSS` naming conventions
//    where appropriate. Some of these files (such as
//    `page/*.less`) _could_ live with their page templates.
